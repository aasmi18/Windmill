# Documentation for Windmill Project

Situation:
The objective of this project was to create an interactive windmill animation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The animation should include multiple windmills, clouds moving across the sky, birds flying, and a day/night mode toggle. The animation should also be responsive and fit within a specified template.

Task:
The main tasks involved in this project were:
Set up the HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript environment.
Draw static elements such as the background (sky, ground, mountains, trees), windmills, and clouds.
Animate the windmill blades, cloud movement, and bird movement.
Implement a day/night mode toggle.
Make the animation responsive and fit within a specified template.

Action:
To accomplish these tasks, we took the following actions:

Resources and Assets:
We used the HTML5 <canvas> element and JavaScript to create the animation.
We didn't use any external libraries or assets for this project.
Our inspiration came from various online tutorials and examples related to HTML5 Canvas animations.


Drawing Static Elements:
We used the ctx.beginPath(), ctx.moveTo(), ctx.lineTo(), ctx.closePath(), ctx.fillStyle, and ctx.fill() methods to draw static elements like the background, mountains, trees, windmills, and clouds.
The challenge was to create realistic-looking shapes and apply appropriate colors and gradients.
We overcame this challenge by breaking down the shapes into simpler paths and experimenting with different color combinations and gradients.


Animating Elements:
We used the requestAnimationFrame() method to create an animation loop and update the positions of the windmill blades, clouds, and birds on each frame.
The challenge was to calculate the correct angles and positions for the rotating windmill blades and moving clouds and birds.
We overcame this challenge by using basic trigonometry and carefully tracking the positions of each element in the animation loop.


Day/Night Mode Toggle:
We added a click event listener to the canvas to toggle between day and night modes.
The challenge was to change the background colors, sun/moon position, and visibility of birds based on the selected mode.
We overcame this challenge by using conditional statements to check the current mode and update the relevant elements accordingly.


Responsiveness and Template Integration:
We added a container element to hold the canvas and used CSS to position and size the canvas within the container.
The challenge was to ensure the animation resized correctly when the window was resized, and adjust the number of elements (windmills, trees) based on the available space.
We overcame this challenge by adding a resize event listener to update the canvas dimensions, and adjusting the number of windmills and trees based on the canvas width.

Result:
The result of these actions is a working interactive windmill animation that meets the project requirements. You can find the live demo here
